# Iris Dataset Visualization

This project provides visualizations for the popular Iris dataset using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib. The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal of the project is to explore relationships and distributions among these features and visualize them through different types of plots.

# Project Overview

This project uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to create a variety of plots, helping to visualize the relationships between the features of the Iris dataset. These visualizations include pair plots, scatter plots, KDE plots, and pie charts, among others.

# Dataset

The project uses the built-in Iris dataset available in Seaborn. It consists of 150 samples with the following features:

sepal_length (cm)

sepal_width (cm)

petal_length (cm)

petal_width (cm)

species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

# Visualizations

General Statistics Plot: A pair plot to display relationships between all features, colored by species.

Species Frequency Pie Chart: A pie chart showing the frequency distribution of each species in the dataset.

Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width: A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between sepal length and sepal width for each species.

Petal Length vs. Petal Width: A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between petal length and petal width for each species.

KDE Plots: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots to visualize the distribution of sepal and petal features for the Setosa species.

# Dependencies

To run the code in this project, the following Python libraries are required:

seaborn

matplotlib
